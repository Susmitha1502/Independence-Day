# Independence-Day

I am a patriotic fellow, As a tech student I thought of doing something creative for Independence day, and using HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT I designed this webpage. I was new to Web Development and tried my best to develop this with 15 days of knowledge on Web Development.

HAPPY INDEPENDENCE DAY...
